# ASHF Management Portal

A Next.js 14 application designed to streamline the management of academic indexed journals, specifically for "Anales del Seminario de Historia de la Filosof√≠a" (ASHF). Because researching medieval theologians and embracing modern technology aren't mutually exclusive endeavors.

## Features
